# The GAP package subgroupladders

This package provides an algorithm that computes a subgroup ladder from a permutation group up to the parent symmetric group. 
There is also a function included which computes portions of the table of marks using subgroup chains. 
The authors hope that this will someday be extended to use arbitrary subgroup ladders.

## Documentation

The documentation of this package is available as [HTML](https://subgroupladders.hrnz.li/) and as a [PDF](https://subgroupladders.hrnz.li/manual.pdf).
It can also be generated locally with `gap makedoc.g`.
